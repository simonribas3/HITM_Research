# JSE for Eigenvectors

One factor model PCA vs JSE

Then we extend JSE for eigenvectors testing environment to handle a four factor simulation

The goal will then be to use real data on four factors

files: 

JSE_IS_OS_BT is the jupyter notebook with in sample, out of sample, and bias tests for a one factor model on real historical data

JSE_support is the class that generates one/four factor returns

JSE_main is the program that executes simulations and plots
  - working on getting the program to construct a four factor covariance matrix
